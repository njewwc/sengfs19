# Project 2: Design Focus (team) : Architecture and System Design Process: Fall 2019 CS4320/7320 Software Engineering

## Group Assignment using Course Group Set 1
In this exercise, you will use a provided requirements analysis from assignment 2 to produce an architecture design for the programming assignment submission service.
Here’s a recap of the problem from assignment #2:

## Problem
  - Need: A method for easily submitting and collecting programming assignments.
  - Purpose: To create a system which allows students in programming classes to submit programming work. Additionally, the TAs must be able to collect assignments. Finally, the instructors need to be capable of managing the course, its sections, TAs, and assignments.
  - Client Base: CS Department – faculty, staff, and students

## Deliverable
Create a document with a title page, including your group, group member names and the exercise name. Then complete the steps below, presenting the information in an organized fashion. When you are finished, one of you submit a PDF of your document to Canvas. Note the details under Step 4 regarding other document requirements.

### Step 1
  - In this exercise, you will create design diagrams like the ones from class. Your first step is to find a software program that you can use to draw these diagrams. You’re welcome to use any program for this assignment. Here are a few suggestions:
    - yEd: http://www.yworks.com/products/yed (Links to an external site.)
    - Microsoft Visio or Powerpoint 
    - Sketchbook: https://sketchbook.com/?locale=en (Links to an external site.)
    - Violet UML Editor: http://alexdp.free.fr/violetumleditor/page.php (Links to an external site.)
    - Draw IO : http://www.draw.io (Links to an external site.) (recommended by Jeremy)

### Step 2
  - [To provide a common base for this assignment, all groups will be working from the same requirements based off of Exercise 2](./4-assignment-3-support-files/4-Design-requirements.md). Familiarize yourself as individuals and as a team with these requirements and ask questions in the Slack channel #design to clarify anything that needs clarified.

### Step 3
  - In lecture, we covered a few types of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams:
    - Use Case Diagram
    - Entity-Relationship Modeling Diagrams
    - Class Diagrams
    - Activity Diagrams
    - Sequence Diagrams
    - State Machines
  - Your team is responsible for several diagrams. Each individual should contribute to three different types of diagrams, through either independent design, design collaboration, or careful peer review of a finished diagram. 
    - Carefully plan responsibilities for design and peer review so each individual works on three different types of diagrams and each of the following is accomplished:
    - For one of the activities in the Requirements document, create a Use Case Diagram and the associated Use Case Description.
    - For 3-person teams, take three of the Activities, and for 4-person teams, take 4 of the Activities (different activities than the use case) in the Requirements document and create an activity diagram to demonstrate the flow of the system. Each individual should contribute to an activity diagram.
    - For one of the Activities in the Requirements document (a different Activity) create a class diagram to demonstrate the class(es) and entity relations.
    - For each of the other three types of UML diagrams in the list above, use it to represent another part of the system. This includes 
       - an Entity-Relationship diagram, 
       - a sequence diagram, and 
       - a state machine.

### Step 4
  - Compile the diagrams into the group document as described under Deliverable.
    - Provide a table of contents. 
    - Each diagram should have a title and caption describing what it shows.
    - Each diagram should indicate who worked on it and in what role.
  - Your work will be assessed on the completeness, consistency, clarity and notational correctness of your group design and your adherence to the scope of the project.
  - Your Group Assignment is due in each team members repository at 11:59 pm on Wednesday, September 18, 2019.
