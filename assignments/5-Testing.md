# 5-Testing
**The core of this assignment's materials are forked from: https://github.com/pluralsight/intro-to-pytest **

1. Setup a python virtual environment at the command line `virtualenv --python=python3 testing`
2. From the same directory, `source testing/bin/activate`
3. Change in the command line to the directory in the course repo (which you will either `git pull` if you already cloned it, or `git clone` if you have not. The url is `https://github.com/computationalmystic/sengfs19`)
4. [Open the README.md file and review its content and perform the required setup](../5-intro-to-pytest/README.md) There are some libraries you need to install, and instructions provided
5. Complete tutorials 00-05. If you finish early, help others. In class, work in groups of 2 during class

## Complete Assignment
1. Finish as much of the tutorial as you need to. 
2. Write five tests for functions in your design document. 
3. Write five python files that fail those tests. 
4. Write five python files that pass those tests. (One for each test!)
