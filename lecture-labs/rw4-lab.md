# Assignment Lab in Groups
1. You will be assigned to work in your groups on this week's assignments. 
2. (5 minutes) Sit in your assigned group area. You can move around when you find each other. Your groups are in Canvas for FERPA reasons.

3. (10 minutes) In those groups, begin to understand the requirements document for the project, which is a [standard version of the document you constructed in your last assignment.](../assignments/4-assignment-3-support-files/4-Design-requirements.md) and [the assignment itself](../assignments/4-design-analysis-group-project.md)
4. (15 minutes) Create a class diagram for one part of the overall system, including the needs of each of the users in the sample requirements. 
    - Take a photo of your diagram
    - Upload it to one of your team member repositories 
    - Every member of the group should past a link in today's lab markdown to the photo uploaded, which can take the form of the full url in a simple markdown document for this lab's folder, referencing where your team's picture is. 
5. (5 minutes)[Reference the readings available to ensure that you have a full understanding of the materials at your disposal for understanding the design process](../assignments/4-assignment-3-support-files/DesignReadings.md)
6. (25 minutes) Create, as for as you can, a full ERD for the system you are constructing using paper and pen or pencil. Your assignment requires you to submit this in a digital tool, but we are sketching it out now. **You May want to have each group member take 1 or 2 of the users of the system and do independent models, which you later integrate. If. you do that, just upload the photo of your contribution to your repository**
    - Take a photo of your diagram
    - Upload it to one of your team member repositories 
    - Every member of the group should past a link in today's lab markdown to the photo uploaded, which can take the form of the full url in a simple markdown document for this lab's folder, referencing where your team's picture is. 
7. (10 Minutes) In a markdown document that you save to each of your own repositories, create a specific plan for when and how and where you are going to work as a group to complete this week's assignment. Some people are busier or have less control of their time than others, so be thoughtful about this. 
8. (5 Minutes) Share your paper diagrams that you photographed with Caleb and ask any questions you have about the assignment on Slack or in office hours.
